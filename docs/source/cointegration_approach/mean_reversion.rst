Mean Reverison
==============

According to Ernest P. Chan:
"The mathematical description of a mean-reverting price series is that the change of the price series
in the next period is proportional to the difference between the mean price and the current price. This
gives rise to the ADF test, which tests whether we can reject the null hypothesis that the proportionality
constant is zero."

The Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller (ADF) test is based on the idea that the current price level gives us information about the future
price level: if it's lower than the mean, the next move will be upwards, and vice versa.

The ADF test uses the linear model that describes the price changes as follows:

.. math::

    \Delta y(t) = \lambda y(t-1) + \mu + \beta t + \alpha_1 \Delta y(t-1) + ... \alpha_k \Delta y(t-k) + \epsilon_t

where :math:`\Delta y(t) \equiv y(t) - y(t-1)`, :math:`\Delta y(t) \equiv y(t-1) - y(t-2)`, ...

The hypothesis that is being tested is: :math:`\lambda = 0`. For simplicity we assume the drift term
to be zero (:math:`\beta = 0`). If we reject the hypothesis, this means that the next price move
depends on the current price level.

Mean reversion tests, such as ADF usually require at least 90 percent certainty. But in practice, we can
create strategies that are profitable even at lower certainty levels. The measure :math:`\lambda` can be
used to calculate the *half-life*, which indicates how long it takes for a price to mean revert:

.. math::

    Half-life = -log(2) / \lambda

Furthermore, we can see that if the :math:`\lambda` value is positive, the price series are not mean-reverting.
If it's close to zero, the half-life is very long and the strategy won't be profitable due to slow mean
reversion.

Half-life period can be helpful to determine some of the parameters to use in the trading strategy.
Say, if the half-life period is 20 days, then using 5 days backward-looking window for moving average
or volatility calculation may not give the best results.

The most common approach is to use two cointegrated price series to construct a portfolio. This is done by
simultaneously going long on one asset and short on the other, with an appropriate capital allocation
for each asset. This approach is also called a "pairs trading strategy". However, the approach can be
extended to three and more assets.

.. Note::

    Another set of tools for pairs trading strategies is available in our Optimal Mean Reversion Module.

Johansen cointegration test
###########################

This is one of the most widely used cointegration tests, it's upside is that it can be applied to
multiple price series. Another common approach - the Cointegrated Augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF)
test can only be used on a pair of price series and is not covered in this module.

A motivation to use the Johansen approach instead of the simple ADF test is that, first it allows
multiple price series for stationarity testing, and second it provides hedge ratios for price
series used to combine elements into a stationary portfolio.

To understand how to test the cointegration of more than two variables, we can transform the equation
used in the ADF test to a vector form. So :math:`y(t)` would be vectors representing multiple price
series, and the :math:`\lambda` and :math:`\alpha` are matrices. We also assume that the drift term is
zero (:math:`\beta t = 0`). So the equation can be rewritten as follows:

.. math::

    \Delta Y(t) = \Lambda Y(t-1) + M + A_1 \Delta Y(t-1) + ... + A_k \Delta Y(t-k) + \epsilon_t

This way we can test the hypothesis of :math:`\Lambda = 0`, in which case, we don't have cointegration
present. Denoting the rank of the obtained matrix :math:`\Lambda` as :math:`r` and the number of price series
as :math:`n`, the number of independent portfolios that can be formed is equal to :math:`r`.

The Johansen test calculates the :math:`r` and tests the hypotheses of :math:`r = 0` (cointegrating
relationship exists), :math:`r \le 1`, ..., :math:`r \le n - 1`. In case all the above hypotheses are
rejected, the result is that :math:`r = n` and the eigenvectors of the :math:`\Lambda` can be used as
hedge ratios to construct a mean-reverting portfolio.

Note that the Johansen test is independent of the order of the price series, in contrast to the CADF test.

The Johansen test from the MlFInLab package allows getting the cointegration vectors, trace statistics,
and eigenvector statistics from a given dataframe with price series. Note that the two last statistics
will be calculated only if the input dataframe contains 12 or less price series.

Engle-Granger cointegration test
################################

The cointegration testing approach proposed by Engle-Granger allows us to test whether two or more price
series are cointegrated of a given order.

The Engle-Granger cointegration test is performed as follows:

- First, we need to determine the order of integration of variables :math:`x` and :math:`y`
  (or :math:`y_{1}, y_{2}, ...` in case of more than two variables). If they are integrated of the
  same order, we can apply the cointegration test.
- Next, if the variables are integrated of order one at the previous step, the following regressions
  can be performed:

.. math::

    x_t = a_0 + a_1 y_t + e_{1,t},

    y_t = b_0 + b_1 x_t + e_{2,t}

- Finally we run the following regressions and test for unit root for each equation:

.. math::

    \Delta e_{1,t} = a_1 e_{1, t-1} + v_{1, t},

    \Delta e_{2,t} = a_2 e_{2, t-1} + v_{2, t}

If we cannot reject the null hypotheses that :math:`|a_1| = 0` and :math:`|a_2| = 0`, we cannot
reject the hypotheis that the variables are not cointegrated.

The hedge ratios for constructing a mean-reverting portfolio in the case of the Engle-Granger test
are set to :math:`1` for the :math:`x` variable and the coefficient :math:`-a_1` for the :math:`y`
variable (or :math:`-a_1, -a_2, ..` in case of multiple :math:`y_i` price series).

The Engle-Granger cointegration test implemented in the MlFinLab package assumes that the first step
of the algorithm is passed and that the variables are integrated of order one. This test allows us to
get cointegration vectors, ADF test statistics for the null hypotheses in the final step from a given
dataframe with price series.

Half-life of mean-reversion
###########################

This module contains a function that allows calculating a half-life of the mean-reversion process
under the assumption that data follows the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process can be described using a formula:

.. math::

    dy(t) = ( \lambda y(t-1) + \mu ) dt + d \varepsilon

where :math:`d \varepsilon` is some Gaussian noise.

Linear trading strategy
#######################

Using a mean-reverting portfolio obtained from the Johansen test, a linear mean-reverting trading strategy
can be constructed.

The idea is to own a number of units of a portfolio proportional to their negative normalized deviation
from its moving average (the Z-score). A unit portfolio is the one with shares of its elements determined
by the eigenvector of the :math:`\Lambda` matrix from the Johansen test.

So the number of portfolio units to hold (:math:`N_t`) is calculated as:

.. math::

    N_{t} = \frac{P_{t} - MA(P_{t}, T_{MA})}{std(P_{t}, T_{std})}

where

- :math:`P_{t}` is the price of a portfolio,

- :math:`MA(P_{t}, T_{MA})` is the moving average of the portfolio price calculated
  using a backward-looking :math:`T_{MA}` window,

- :math:`std(P_{t}, T_{std})` is the rolling standard deviation of the portfolio price
  calculated using a backward-looking :math:`T_{std}` window.

Linear strategy in this case means that the number of invested units is proportional to the Z-Score
and not that the market value of our investment is proportional.

For this basic strategy, the maximum required capital is unknown, therefore it's not a very practical
one in its simplest version.

The upside however is that this strategy has no parameters to optimize (the windows for moving average
and the rolling standard deviation taken equal to the half-life period) and is useful for backtesting
the properties of a mean-reverting price series.

With an input of portfolio price series, a backward-looking window for a simple moving average, and a
window for rolling st. deviation, the function will output a dataframe with portfolio price series
alongside with the Z-Scores and target quantities of the unit portfolio to hold.

Bollinger Bands trading strategy
################################

This is a more practical strategy in comparison to the Linear Trading strategy mentioned in this module,
as it deals with the issues present in the linear strategy: infinitesimal portfolio rebalances and no
predefined buying power (as the costs needed to be allocated to the strategy are dependant on the Z-score).

By using the Bollinger bands on the Z-scores from the linear mean-reversion trading strategy, we can
construct a more practical trading strategy. The idea is to enter a position only when the price
deviates by more than *entryZscore* standard deviations from the mean. This parameter can be optimized
in a training set.

Also, the look-back windows for calculating the mean and the standard deviation are the parameters that
can be optimized. We can later exit the strategy when the price reverts to the *exitZscore* standard
deviations from the mean (*exitZscore* :math:`<` *entryZscore*).

If *exitZscore* :math:`= -` *entryZscore*, we will exit when the price moves beyond the opposite band,
also triggering a trading signal of the opposite sign. At either time we can have either zero or one
unit (long or short) invested, so capital allocation is easy.

If the look-back window is short and we set a small *entryZscore* and *exitZscore*, the holding period
will be shorter and we get more round trip trades and generally higher profits.

With an input of portfolio price series, a window for a simple moving average, a window for
simple moving st. deviation, and entry and exit label Z-Scores, the function will output a dataframe
with portfolio price series alongside with the Z-Scores and target quantities of the unit portfolio to
buy or sell.
