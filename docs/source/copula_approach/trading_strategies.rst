Trading Strategy
==================

.. Note::
    The following strategy closely follow the implementations:

        * Liew, Rong Qi, and Yuan Wu. "Pairs trading: a copula approach." (2013).
        * Stander, Yolanda, DaniÃ«l Marais, and Ilse Botha. "Trading strategies with copulas." (2013).

The trading strategy using copula is implemented as a long-short pairs trading scheme, and uses rules from general
long-short pairs trading framework.

    are considered extreme when using a 99% confidence level and the N14 copula dependence structure.

Probability Threshold Strategy
##############################
We start with a pair of stocks of interest :math:`S_1` and :math:`S_2`, which can be selected by various methods.
For example, using Engle-Granger test for cointegration.
By consensus, we define the spread as :math:`S_1` in relation to :math:`S_2`.
e.g. Short the spread means buying :math:`S_1` and/or selling :math:`S_2`.

Use **cumulative log return** data of the stocks during the training/formation period, we proceed a pseudo-MLE
fit to establish a copula that reflects the relation of the two stocks during training/formation period.

Then we can calculate the **marginal cumulative probabilities** using trading/testing period data:

.. math::
    \begin{align}
    P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2), \\
    P(U_2\le u_2 | U_1 = u_1).
    \end{align}

- :math:`u_i \in [0, 1]` is the quantile of trading period data mapped by a CDF formed in the training period.

- When :math:`P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2) < 0.5`, then stock 1 is considered under-valued.

- When :math:`P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2) > 0.5`, then stock 1 is considered over-valued.

Now we define an upper threshold :math:`b_{up}` (e.g. 0.95) and a lower threshold :math:`b_{lo}` (e.g. 0.05),
then the logic is as follows:

- If :math:`P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2) < b_{lo}` and :math:`P(U_2\le u_2 | U_1 = u_1) > b_{up}`, then stock 1 is
  undervalued, and stock 2 is overvalued. Hence we long the spread.

- If :math:`P(U_2\le u_2 | U_1 = u_1) < b_{lo}` and :math:`P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2) > b_{up}`, then stock 2 is
  undervalued, and stock 1 is overvalued. Hence we short the spread.

- If one of the conditional probabilities cross the boundary of :math:`0.5` in relation to its previous time step,
  then we exit the position, as we consider the position is no longer valid.

With an input of portfolio price series, a backward-looking window for a simple moving average, and a
window for rolling st. deviation, the function will output a dataframe with portfolio price series
alongside with the Z-Scores and target quantities of the unit portfolio to hold.
